Write Code to Save Data to Google Sheet: In your MongoDB application, write code to interact with the Google Sheets API and save data to the Google Sheet.

Use the create method in MongoDB to insert data into your database and then write code to retrieve the data and save it to the Google Sheet.

Test the code: Test your code to make sure it is working correctly and saving data to the Google Sheet as expected.
